                        <h2> Hi, I'm Allie! </h2>
                        <p> I am a software developer in the making, and I am currently living in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
                         I'm currently working as a personal trainer, yoga instructor, and a retail associate at lululemon athletica
                        During the covid-19 pandemic, I began re-evaluating the current direction of my life and my career. 
                        After a suggestion from a family member and a client, I gave coding a try. I was hooked!
